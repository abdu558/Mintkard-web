For example, to retrieve the Card object with an id of flashcard_id, you can use the following code:

flashcard = Card.query.get(flashcard_id)

Once you have the Card object, you can call the study() method on it to update its attributes.

To persist the changes to the database, you will need to call the db.session.commit() method after making the changes to the object.

For example, you could modify the study_flashcard route as follows:

@app.route('/study_flashcard/<flashcard_id>/<quality>')
def study_flashcard(flashcard_id, quality):
    flashcard = Card.query.get(flashcard_id)
    flashcard.study(quality)
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('index'))


@app.route('/study_flashcard/<flashcard_id>/<quality>')
def study_flashcard(flashcard_id, quality):
    flashcard = Flashcard.query.get(flashcard_id)
    flashcard.study(quality)
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

This will update the easiness_factor, interval, and last_study columns in the corresponding row in the cards table to reflect the changes made to the flashcard object.


@app.route('/study_flashcard', methods=['POST'])
def study_flashcard():
    flashcard_id = request.form['flashcard_id']
    quality = int(request.form['quality'])

    flashcard = Flashcard.query.get(flashcard_id)

    # Update the flashcard's study information
    flashcard.study(quality)

    db.session.commit()

    return 'Flashcard studied successfully'

This route will update the study information of the flashcard with the provided ID based on the provided quality form data (a rating from 1 to 4). The study method of the Flashcard model should be implemented to update the flashcard's easiness factor, interval, and last reviewed date based on the provided quality rating.

Remember to import the Flashcard model and create a Flask-SQLAlchemy db instance in your Flask application before using this route.



@app.route('/create_flashcard_with_gaps', methods=['POST'])
def create_flashcard_with_gaps():
    deck_id = request.form['deck_id']
    question = request.form['question']
    answer = request.form['answer']
    gaps = request.form['gaps']

    # Split the gaps string into a list of gap indices
    gap_indices = [int(gap) for gap in gaps.split(',')]

    # Replace the gap indices with spaces in the answer string
    for index in gap_indices:
        answer = answer[:index] + ' ' + answer[index+1:]

    flashcard = FlashcardWithGaps(deck_id=deck_id, question=question, answer=answer, gaps=gaps)

    db.session.add(flashcard)
    db.session.commit()

    return 'Flashcard with gaps created successfully'

This route will create a new flashcard with gaps based on the provided question, answer, and gaps form data. The gaps parameter should be a string of comma-separated gap indices (e.g. "2,5,7"). These gap indices will be used to replace the corresponding characters in the answer string with spaces.

Remember to import the FlashcardWithGaps model and create a Flask-SQLAlchemy db instance in your Flask application before using this route.


@app.route('/create_deck', methods=['POST'])
def create_deck():
    name = request.form['name']
    parent_id = request.form['parent_id']

    # If parent_id is not provided, create a new root level deck
    if parent_id is None:
        deck = Deck(name=name)
    else:
        # Create a new subdeck with the provided parent_id
        deck = Deck(name=name, parent_id=parent_id)

    db.session.add(deck)
    db.session.commit()

    return 'Deck created successfully'

@app.route('/get_flashcards', methods=['GET'])
def get_flashcards():
    deck_id = request.args.get('deck_id')
    flashcards = Card.query.filter_by(deck_id=deck_id).all()
    return render_template('flashcards.html', flashcards=flashcards)


subdecks = db.relationship("Deck", back_populates="parent_deck")
    parent_deck_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('decks.id'))
    parent_deck = db.relationship("Deck", back_populates="subdecks",

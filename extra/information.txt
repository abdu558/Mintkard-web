To use parameterized SQL in SQLAlchemy, you will need to use the text() function to create a TextClause object and the bindparam() function to create a BindParameter object.

Here is an example of how you could use parameterized SQL in a SELECT statement to retrieve flashcards from a database:

from sqlalchemy import text, bindparam

# Create a `TextClause` object with the parameterized SQL
query = text("SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE subject = :subject")

# Create a `BindParameter` object for the `subject` parameter
subject_param = bindparam("subject", value=subject)

# Execute the query with the `BindParameter` object
result = conn.execute(query, subject_param)

In this example, the subject parameter is passed as a BindParameter object when the query is executed. This allows you to safely pass user input as a parameter to the query, rather than concatenating it directly into the SQL string, which can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

You can also use parameterized SQL in other types of SQL statements, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Just be sure to use the appropriate bindparam() function for the type of parameter you are using (e.g., bindparam() for string parameters, bindparam() for integer parameters, etc.).

              Answer: Apollo 1, initially designated AS-204, was intended to be
              the first crewed mission of the Apollo program,[1] the American
              undertaking to land the first man on the Moon. It was planned to
              launch on February 21, 1967, as the first low Earth orbital test
              of the Apollo command and service module. The mission never flew;
              a cabin fire during a launch rehearsal test at Cape Kennedy Air
              Force Station Launch Complex 34 on January 27 killed all three
              crew members—Command Pilot Gus Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White, and
              Pilot Roger B. Chaffee—and destroyed the command module (CM). The
              name Apollo 1, chosen by the crew, was made official by NASA in
              their honor after the fire. Immediately after the fire, NASA
              convened an Accident Review Board to determine the cause of the
              fire, and both chambers of the United States Congress conducted
              their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The
              ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and
              the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material and the
              high-pressure pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. Rescue was prevented
              by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the
              internal pressure of the cabin. Because the rocket was unfueled,
              the test had not been considered hazardous, and emergency
              preparedness for it was poor. During the Congressional
              investigation, Senator Walter Mondale publicly revealed a NASA
              internal document citing problems with prime Apollo contractor
              North American Aviation, which became known as the Phillips
              Report. This disclosure embarrassed NASA Administrator James E.
              Webb, who was unaware of the document's existence, and attracted
              controversy to the Apollo program. Despite congressional
              displeasure at NASA's lack of openness, both congressional
              committees ruled that the issues raised in the report had no
              bearing on the accident. Crewed Apollo flights were suspended for
              twenty months while the command module's hazards were addressed.
              However, the development and uncrewed testing of the lunar module
              (LM) and Saturn V rocket continued. The Saturn IB launch vehicle
              for Apollo 1, SA-204, was used for the first LM test flight,
              Apollo 5. The first successful crewed Apollo mission was flown by
              Apollo 1's backup crew on Apollo 7 in October 1968.

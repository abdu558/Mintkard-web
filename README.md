# MintKard

MINTKARD is a active learning spaced-repition platform, which mean it tests your knowledge just when you will normally forget it. This is because if you test knowledge too early then that's useless revision, if it's too late then you would forget the content and have to re-understand it. Mintkard uses it's a algorithim to determine that best time to review it next.

A big feature in Mintkard, is the gamification aspect, to make its users love spending time revising and achieve their goals and potential.

Another big feature is the advanced algorithim that schedules cards to make sure that each card is shown at the best possible time considering the foregetting curve.
